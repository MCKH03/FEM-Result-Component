Hi everyone. I did this project and also
learnt some new techniques during the way
of bulding it. In this markdown I want to
tell some of my issues when bulding it
and also the things that I learned from
building this.

# Things that I learned

1- Well first of all I used linear-gradient myself without
the help of anybody and I think I did actually a good job.

2- During making "76 out of 100" circle I had the problem
that the text were not at the center of the circle. Well
I could use margin and padding to put at the center but I
wanted to happen automatically. So after putting some time
and experiencing different kinds of ways, I used flexbox but
in a column direction and used align-items and justify-content
to put at the center. It was fun!

3- Well I used flexbox pretty much in this design and I think
it really expanded my knowledge of flexbox.

# Thing that I had problem with (I appreciate your help for that)

1- First of all I don't know why I couldn't put the main div at
the center with margin: 0 auto; . I used this property all the time
to put the main div at the center of the body but it didn't work. So
I had to put it at the center using margin myself.

2- Another problem is the corner borders of the 4 boxes in right.
I searched a lot for it, multiple linear-gradients, svgs and many
other ways were the solutions but I couldn't figure out any of them!

3- Also I wanted to put transtiton for the "continue" button but it
seems that background-image doesn't take transtion so I couldn't find
a way for transtitioning my button from the state color to the gradient
color while hovored.

# Conclusion

Anyhow, I think my design was pretty close to what it is in frontend mentor.
I hope you liked it too and I really appreciate your help for the problems
that I mentioned above.
